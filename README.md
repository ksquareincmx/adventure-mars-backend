## Pre requirements

- node.js v8.X.X
- MySQL server
- build essentials for your system
- create a DB called 'geocache' with utf8 encoding

## Configuration

You must have `gulp-cli` installed globally on your machine. You can install it running the following command:

```
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

and you must have all the project's dependencies installed. You can install them running the following command:

```
npm install
```

Then you must create a copy of `.env.example` called `.env` and put all your `env variables` there

```
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running the app

```
gulp watch
```

## Configure MySQL

If you are using MySQL 8.0 or newer, you will need to change the configuration of the MySQL server to allow password authentication, you can do it running the next lines inside the mysql cli (`mysql -u root -p`):

```
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

Where `root` is your user `localhost` id your URL and `password` is your password.

You also need to configure the timezones form MySQL, on macOS use this command (ignore warnings):

```
mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql
```

**TLDR:** For local development (no password) do:

```
mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql
mysql -u root -p
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```
